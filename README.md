# IT1244 Final Project: Machine Learning for Cancer Detection Using DNA Fragment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project develops and evaluates machine learning models for early cancer detection and classification using DNA fragment length profiles. Cancer is a disease where genetic mutations can alter the length and proportions of DNA fragments in a patient's genome. By analyzing the relationship between the proportions of known DNA fragment lengths, we aim to identify the existence and stage of cancer in patients.

The dataset consists of max normalized frequencies of DNA fragment lengths (350 features) and a response variable indicating health status or cancer stage. The project focuses on building classifiers to:

- Distinguish healthy individuals from those with cancer
- Differentiate early-stage cancer vs healthy
- Differentiate screening-stage cancer vs healthy

## Biological Motivation

Cancer often remains asymptomatic until advanced stages, making early detection critical for effective, non-invasive treatment. Genetic mutations in cancer can change the distribution of DNA fragment lengths. By profiling these fragment proportions, machine learning models can be trained to detect cancer presence and stage without requiring prior identification of specific genetic markers.

## Data & Preprocessing

- **Train_Set.csv**: 2193 samples
- **Test_Set.csv**: 1034 samples
- **Features**: 350 max normalized frequencies of DNA fragment lengths
- **Classes**: healthy, early-stage cancer, screening-stage cancer, mid-stage cancer, late-stage cancer

Preprocessing steps include:

- Checking for missing data (none found)
- Filtering response variables for each classification scenario
- Standardizing features
- Converting response variable to binary (0: healthy, 1: cancer)

## Feature Selection Techniques

To avoid overfitting and improve model generalization, four feature selection methods were used:

- **L1 Lasso Regularization**: Penalizes less important features, removing those with low impact.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality by retaining principal components explaining most variance.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively removes least important features based on logistic regression p-values.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies and removes highly correlated features to reduce redundancy.

Features are scored across these methods, and only the most significant are retained for each classification scenario.

## Machine Learning Techniques

- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised grouping of similar DNA profiles to explore data structure.
- **Logistic Regression**: Models the probability of cancer presence using a sigmoid function; outputs binary predictions.
- **Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods**: RandomForest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoosting classifiers for interpretable, tree-based classification. Max depth set to 8 to prevent overfitting.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based classification; hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation (GridSearchCV) used to optimize K.
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)**: Probabilistic classification assuming normal distribution of features; log-transform applied to features to better approximate normality.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Used to assess model performance, with emphasis on minimizing false negatives (FN) due to higher clinical cost.
- **Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall Curves**: Visual and quantitative evaluation of classifier effectiveness.

## Results & Discussion

- Logistic Regression and GNB showed moderate precision and recall, with high recall for cancer detection but lower for other outcomes.
- Decision Tree ensembles (RandomForest, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting) achieved higher precision and F1 scores, with boosting methods helping to reduce overfitting.
- KNN performance was optimized using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction were critical to avoid overfitting and improve generalization to unseen test data.
